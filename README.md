## Teacher Interface

Hello everyone. Now we have entered the teacher interface where details about the quiz, student and questions will be entered.

First the details about the quiz have to be entered. 
The teacher is required to enter the number of students that will take up the quiz. 
The number of questions that each student will have to take up in the quiz
and the number of options to be displayed for every question

** as i am saying this you can keep entering the details**

Now that the details of the quiz have been entered the teacher is required to move on to the entry
of the details of the students

The name of the student that will be taking up the quiz is taken in

Now the program generates a random 10 character password containing upper and lower case letters.
This password has to be given to the student by the teacher before the student enters the quiz. 
This password is unique and given to the student to prevent malpractice 
such as students taking up the quiz for others wihtout their knowledge. 

** as i am explaining the part about the passwords you can keep entering the details about the other students**

Now that the student details have been entered we can move on to entering details of the questions one by one
Since the teacher has declared that 3 students will take up the quiz and each student will get two questions,
the teacher will be required to enter a total of 6 questions

**You can begin with the entry of the questions as i am explaining the part about the number of questions**

This page requires the teacher to give the question, the possible options and the correct option in either upper or lower 
case from the list of options

**By now you should be done with the questions**

After all the questions have been entered the teacher is required to give a time limit the students will get in minutes


Once the details of the questions have also been entered the platform is now ready for the students to take up the quiz
